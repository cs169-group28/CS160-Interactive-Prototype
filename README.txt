Some limitations of our current implementation are that we can't create a profile.  This means that everyone is effectively the same user, because we haven't implemented logging in yet.  Also, users can't collaborate with each other because the users are not unique.  Another limitation is that we can't easily see the total budget for each task because we haven't implemented the autoadd field yet.  A backend limitation we have right now is that we can only add objectives to one task.  All tasks share the same objectives due to our current limitations.  Some of our pages aren't particularly descriptive due to the fact that we have many fields yet to add to our forms and database.  Since they weren't important to the tasks we were trying to prototype in this iteration, we left them fairly unimplented.  

Helpful Tips:
When adding dates and times to an event, most logical formats of dates and times will be sufficient.

As of right now, you can only add tasks to one event. If you try to create tasks for a different event, they will be the same.

Also, the objectives are the same across tasks; do not try to add objectives to two different tasks.

When adding objectives and resources, please press enter while in the last form field of the row (if there is only one form field, just press enter to add the objective/resource).
